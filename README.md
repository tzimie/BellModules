Bell - Action at a Distance - OpsDev - Reverse DevOps solution (server module)

While Devops typically deals with a flow from Dev to PROD (code Deploys), there is a little done to support a limited data flow in an opposite direction - to provide an info for the developers about non-sensitive data from PROD - performance metrics, configs, log files, volumetry. Because RDP, solutions like CA PAM or even read-only access to a database can expose sensitive data such access is very limited and requires an approval, even in most cases the developers need an access to few minor things to investigate the problems and to improve the performance.

"Bell - action at distance" is an open source solution to facilitate such access to higher environments.
